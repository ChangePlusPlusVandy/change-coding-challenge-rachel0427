For the TweetGame program to work, you need to import a python file
that contains four variables, which are your API_key, API_secret_key,
access_token, and access_token_secret.

To run the program, the play() function needs to be called, and the program
will prompt users for two Tweeter users that they wish to play guess with.

My biggest challenge: I wasn't sure the method I'm using is the right way
to get the maximum 3200 tweets, since the .user_timeline() function only
allows a max of 200 tweets. And also I did not use a HTTP request. If I
have more time to work on this project, I would do more research on this,
and see if there is a faster method to do this, and also explore HTTP requests.
